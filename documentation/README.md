## Purpose/Backstory:
This has been a side project I have been working on here and there when I have the time. I have been using it to practice. 
some HCI and design skills along with getting my toes wet with database management before I start the class in school. I haven't been able
to get to far into it yet due to business in my life currently so work has been limited to breaks and summers.

## The Idea:
My overarching plan for this project is to create a rating game primarily for sports. The basic jist of it that users are presented three athletes from a sport and has to decide which one they want to start, the one they want to bench, and the one they want to cut. Based on their decisions it would show how many people agree with their selection for each athlete. 

EX: Options = Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and Patrick Mahomes

    Start = Tom Brady 
    Bench = Patrick Mahomes
    Cut   = Aaron Rodgers
The proper percentage for each would be displayed according to user choice.

### Note:
There isnâ€™t a lot so far but I hope the general idea and direction is demonstrated clearly.
